# Unified Mobility & Delivery Aggregator 🚕📦

## AI for Bharat Hackathon

**Problem ID:** 06 – AI for Communities, Access & Public Impact
**Team Name:** KURKURE
**Team Lead:** Shivansh Rajput

---

## 📌 Overview

This project proposes a **unified mobility and delivery aggregator platform** that compares multiple ride-hailing and delivery services in real time. Instead of switching between different apps, users can make **smarter, faster, and cheaper decisions** from a single interface.

The solution focuses on **accessibility, fairness, and public impact**, especially for users and riders in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

Existing mobility and delivery platforms operate in isolation. Users must manually check multiple apps to compare prices, ETAs, and availability, while riders often face unfair compensation during adverse conditions.

---

## 🚀 Proposed Solution

A single application that:

* Aggregates multiple ride-hailing and delivery platforms
* Compares **cheapest vs fastest** options in real time
* Uses AI-driven recommendations based on traffic, weather, and demand
* Introduces **weather-based rider incentives** to ensure fair earnings

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Multi-platform fare & ETA comparison
* Cheapest vs fastest route toggle
* Ride booking (cab, bike taxi, auto)
* Parcel, food, and local delivery support
* Weather-based dynamic rider incentives
* Real-time traffic and demand analysis
* Secure in-app payments
* Rider performance & incentive dashboard

---

## 🔄 User Flow (High Level)

1. User enters pickup and destination
2. Selects preference: **Cheapest** or **Fastest**
3. System fetches real-time data from partner platforms
4. AI engine compares price, ETA, traffic, and weather
5. Best option is recommended
6. User confirms booking and tracks ride/delivery

---

## 🧠 AI & Intelligence Layer

* Price optimization models
* ETA prediction
* Traffic & demand analysis
* Weather-based incentive calculation

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**High-level components:**

* Mobile App (User & Rider)
* Aggregation Engine (Ride & Delivery APIs)
* AI Recommendation Engine
* Weather & Traffic Data Services
* Payment Gateway
* Cloud Database (User, Rider, Trip Data)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** Flutter / React Native
* **Backend:** Node.js / Python (FastAPI)
* **AI & ML:** Price optimization & ETA models
* **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, Lambda, RDS, S3)
* **Maps & Traffic:** Google Maps / OpenStreetMap APIs
* **Weather Data:** Real-time weather APIs
* **Payments:** UPI & digital payment gateways
